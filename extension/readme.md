# Web Extensions React starter

A starter repo for building browser extensions with React and Typescript.

Here's what you get:

- :atom_symbol: content scripts, popup and options page as three separate React (v18.2+) apps
- ùôèùôé Typescript (v5.0+) on all apps and other scripts
- üí¨ a common communication channel and storage for all these apps and scripts
- üß© works with Manifest V3 (i.e. works with all Chromium-based browsers and soon Firefox)

## developing your own extension

Short version:

```bash
# install dependencies in all apps thanks to Yarn workspaces
yarn

# run
cd content_scripts/app && yarn start
cd options && yarn start
cd popup && yarn start

# to build
yarn build

# to package into an archive
yarn zip
```

More details:

- learn more about WebExtensions and Manifest files (see [resources](#resources) section)
- update information inside `manifest.json` (name, description, homepage,...) and update icons
- code and test your React apps within `/content_scripts/app`, `/options` and `/popup`
  - all three folders are regular React apps bundled via [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), so just refer to their `package.json` and `vite.config.js` for config, and write code like you would for any other React app
  - if you don't need some of these apps or scripts, simply remove them from the project and remove their build steps in the build pipeline (inside `./build.sh`)
- build/compile your extension by running `yarn build` from the root folder (this executes `./build.sh`), load it in the browser and try it there
  - you can use generated `./build` folder to load the "unpacked" version of the extension in the browser and test it locally (see how [for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest) or [for Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#trying_it_out))
- pack the extension into a single archive
  - run `yarn zip` from the root folder
- publish it on the web stores

  - instructions for [publishing to Firefox Add-ons](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/)

## how it works

Web extensions, and thus this repo, consist of four large parts, plus the manifest file specifying each of those and some additional meta-information. The parts are: content scripts, action/popup, options page and background scripts. A single web extension can have any combination of these, neither of all of them (i.e. all are optional); only the manifest is mandatory.

- The root folder (`./`) holds basic meta-information about the extension, i.e. its manifest and icons.
- `/content_scripts` is a place for the extra JS and CSS that gets injected into the pages that you view while your extension is installed and enabled. `/app` folder within it holds the React app where you basically write the entirety of logic, and the remaining files are there to create a container for your React root (similar to how `div#root` exists in `public/index.html` when using a regular CRA).
- `/popup` is a place for another React app that gets displayed as a popup/dropdown when clicking on the extension's icon displayed near the address bar in the browser.
- `/options` hosts a React app that serves an Options page for the extension where you can configure and persists whatever some common options.
- `/worker` is a place for a service worker (MV3) or a background script (MV2). These scripts can never have any UI as a part of it, so it consists only of TS/JS files, and they run in the background.

By having a very predictable build output (a single JS bundle) for each part of our extension, we can hardcode their script files inside `manifest.json` and that's it - always the same output, always the same entry points and script files, i.e. no need for [programmatic injection](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/#programmatic), dynamic loading or anything complex.

This is a build output:

You can see how that exactly matches the files specified inside of `manifest.json`:
